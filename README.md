## Application Design
This application:
* is meant to run as a simple, standalone app that connects to a lightweight REST backend
* is 100% Kotlin, uses coroutines and Jetpack Compose
* is implemented using a clean architectural approach with an MVVM architecture in the UI layer
* uses Koin for dependency injection, Coil for image loading, Material Design where possible
* is incomplete! (see next section)

## Take Home Practical test
This project is a starting point for students to display technical skills and design creativity.

As such, it intentionally contains:
* incomplete experiences or features
* bugs
* broken patterns
* leaks or inefficiencies

In addition to access to the repository, students will receive several tasks to implement in the codebase.

The panel interview will discuss application architecture and any implementations provided by the candidate.
